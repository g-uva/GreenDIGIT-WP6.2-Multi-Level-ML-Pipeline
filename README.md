## Overview

This framework enables **real-time predictive modelling** across **Cloud, Grid and Network infrastructures** using **multi-level machine learning pipelines**. It ingests environmental and performance metrics (e.g. energy, CPU usage, workload profiles) from **distributed clusters and IoT devices**, processes them, and trains models to **forecast resource usage/availability and energy performance (CFP)**.

Deployed as part of the **GreenDIGIT WP6.2** research activities, this module integrates with:

- [WP6.1 Environmental Metric Publication System](#)
- [WP6.3 Energy-Aware Brokering Framework](#)
- UTH real-time IoT metrics infrastructure, data and workloads
- SoBigData RI metrics ecosystem
- IFCA and DIRAC records infrastructure

### To-dos (create tickets)
- [ ] DVC assets imported from remote storage (GDrive, AWS or server)
- ML model is quite simple. Things to improve.
  - [x] XGBoost, CatBoost (or other SoTA gradient boost tool-algo)
  - [x] Deep Learning: Convolutional Neural Network (LSTM, Temporal Convolution, Transformer) with PyTorch or TensorFlow
  - [ ] Use `scikit-learn-onnx` for more adaptability to edge-devices
  - [x] Integrate MQTT and/or Prometheus for edge-optimised messaging telemetry between devices (for the Edge)
- [ ] Metrics' ingestion: batch API from CNR
- [x] Metrics' ingestion: Kafka + MQTT + Flink/Spark + PostgreSQL/InfluxDB
- [ ] (Optional) Testbed implementation IoT with UTH

## Models used

### Baseline: HistGradientBoostingRegressor (HGBR)
A tree-boosting model from `scikit-learn` used as the initial baseline. It operates on tabular, engineered features (lags, rolling statistics), is fast to train, handles missing values with an imputer, and gives a strong reference MAE/RMSE to beat.

### XGBoost (Gradient Boosted Trees)
High-performance gradient boosting on decision trees (histogram algorithm). Strong on heterogeneous tabular data, captures non-linear interactions well, robust to missing values, and typically competitive as a production baseline. In our pipeline it reads the same engineered features as the baseline and logs train/validation/test metrics plus validation curves to DVC.


### LSTM (sequence model)
A recurrent neural network that ingests sliding **time windows** shaped as `[samples, timesteps, features]`, therefore modelling temporal dependencies explicitly. Useful when recent history strongly determines near-future power. Requires normalised inputs and careful tuning; CPU training is slower than tree models.

### ARIMA/SARIMA
(Seasonal/) Autoregression Integrated Moving Average.
- [ ] TODO: write description.

> The pipeline includes a **champion selector** which chooses the best model by test error and writes `models/champion.json` for the inference service to load.

## Running the service and getting predictions

### 1) Train models and pick a winner
Ensure the DVC pipeline has produced models and metrics:
```bash
# From repo root
dvc repro          # runs ingest → featurise → train → validate_features → train_xgb → reshape_windows → train_lstm → select_champion
dvc metrics show   # compare baseline / xgb / lstm / (s)arima
```

### 2) Start the FastAPI service
```bash
uvicorn service.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Health and model info:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
curl http://localhost:8000/model
```

### 3) Request a prediction
If the champion is **XGBoost/HGBR (tabular)**, send a flat feature dict.
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/predict \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
        "features": {
          "cpu_usage_percent": 12.3,
          "memory_used_bytes": 8200000000,
          "network_bw_rx_b/s": 155000,
          "lag_1h": 320.5,
          "lag_2h": 315.1,
          "lag_3h": 318.9,
          "lag_6h": 310.2
        }
      }'
# → {"power_forecast": <number>}
```
If the "champion" is **LSTM (sequence)**, send the most recent window `[timesteps]` `[features]`.
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/predict \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
        "window": [
          [12.3, 8200000000, 155000, ...],
          [13.1, 8300000000, 160000, ...],
          [11.9, 8100000000, 150000, ...]
          // ... up to the configured window length (e.g., 60 steps)
        ]
      }'
# → {"power_forecast": <number>}
```

#### Notes
- The service loads `models/champion.json`, so deployment remains model-agnostic.
- If your features use CIM paths or aliases, map them to the canonical na
mes server-side before padding missing inputs.
- For production, persist any scalers with the model and apply them inside the service, validate inputs, and secure the endpoint.

## Metrics Ingestion Services (Features)
- Ingest, Featurise and Train stages in-built as a pipeline (with DVC tracking).
- FastAPI server `/predict` endpoint with a `{"power_forecast":<number>}` result.
- MQTT + Kafka + Flink streaming pipeline

## M3L2 MVP Production Path

The scoped MVP lives under `m3l2/`. It does four things:

- fetches execution records from CNR MetricsDB/EIMPS;
- stores normalized records in SQL;
- trains an `energy_wh` model every 6 hours;
- serves forecasts through FastAPI.

Run it:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up --build -d
```

The Docker image uses `requirements-m3l2.txt`, a small runtime dependency set for the API. The broader `requirements.txt` still contains the heavier research stack.

Use the CNR/EIMPS ingestion path:

```bash
# Service status and active model.
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Fetch and store execution records.
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/ingest/run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"start_ts":"2026-01-01T00:00:00Z","end_ts":"2026-01-02T00:00:00Z"}'

# Train manually.
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/train

# Forecast site energy.
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"site_ids":null,"horizon":"24h","step":"1h","use_cache":true}'

# Inspect models and operational counters.
curl http://localhost:8000/models
curl http://localhost:8000/metrics
```

Set `M3L2_ENABLE_SCHEDULER=false` in `.env` to disable automatic ingestion and training.

For local validation, `raw_data/summary_sites_15m.csv` is a 15-minute aggregate, not raw execution-unit data. Expected columns:

```text
bucket_15m,site_id,vo,activity,records,energy_wh,cfp_g,work,ncores
```

Load those aggregate rows into synthetic `execution_records` and trigger training:

```bash
docker compose exec api python scripts/load_raw_aggregate_and_train.py
```

This stores the rows with `status="aggregated"` and `raw_json.source_file="raw_data/summary_sites_15m.csv"`.

Forecast after training:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"site_ids":null,"horizon":"24h","step":"1h","use_cache":true}'
```

Remove those example rows:

```bash
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:8000/control/execution-records?source=raw_data/summary_sites_15m.csv&dry_run=false"
```

If the container was built before this helper script existed, rebuild the API service:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d api
```

### MQTT + Kafka + Flink pipeline tutorial (development)
1. Install `docker-compose` with all containerised services (MQTT + Kafka).
```bash
cd streaming_service # you should see a docker-compose.yaml if you run ls -la
docker compose up -d --build
```

This will spin-up several services included in the compose file, including Kafka-UI, MQTT broker/subscriber and a Kafka bridge that ingests that service.
To see the logs from MQTT and Kafka respectively:
- `docker logs -f mqtt`
- `docker logs -f mqtt_to_kafka`

2. To start the synthetic workloads
```bash
# Go to the synthetic metrics' workload folder.
cd synthetic_metrics_service

# If you do not have the environment installed.
python -m venv .
source bin/activate

# Inside our environment:
python metrics_publisher.py
# From here you should see metrics being recurrently logged.
```

3. Kafka -> ELT (Flink SQL) -> Iceberg + MinIO
```sh
# Some useful command to list Kafka's topics, for debugging.
docker exec -it kafka kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --list

docker exec -it kafka /opt/bitnami/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --list
docker exec -it kafka /opt/bitnami/kafka/bin/kafka-configs.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 \
  --entity-type topics --entity-name metrics.raw.stream --describe

```

4. Generating metrics (temporary)
```sh
# 1) Generate namespaces.json
python generate_namespaces.py --n 12

# 2a) Use existing namespace.json (no auto-generate nodes) (defaults SourceType=IoT)
python generate_synthetic_metrics.py --days 1 --freq-mins 3

# 2b) (Optional) autogenerate 12 IoT nodes
python generate_synthetic_metrics.py --autogen-nodes 12 --days 1 --freq-mins 3

# 3) Publish metrics
# 3-second fixed cadence, override payload timestamps to "now", IoT only
PACE_MODE=cadence CADENCE_S=3 OVERRIDE_TS=true SOURCE_TYPE=IoT \
BROKER=localhost PORT=1883 TOPIC_ROOT=greendigit QOS=1 \
python metrics_publisher.py

# Or: respect recorded Δts (scaled), keep original timestamps
PACE_MODE=replay_ts REPLAY_SPEED=2.0 OVERRIDE_TS=false SOURCE_TYPE=IoT \
python metrics_publisher.py

```
